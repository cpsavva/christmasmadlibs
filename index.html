			 	'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br>
				Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br>
				The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
				In hopes that <!-- St. Nicholas --> <span class="words" id="noun"></span> soon would be there;<br>
				<br>
				The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br>
				While visions of sugar-plums <!-- danced --> <span class="words" id="adjective"></span> in their heads;<br>
				And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,<br>
				Had just settled down for a long winter's nap,<br>
				<br>
				When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
				I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.<br>
				Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>
				Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br>
				<br>
				The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br>
				Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below,<br>
				When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,<br>
				But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,<br>
				With a little old driver, so <!-- lively --> <span class="words" id="adverb"></span> and quick,<br>
				I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>
				<br>
				More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br>
				And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;<br>
				"Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN!<br>
				On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONNER and BLITZEN!<br>
				To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!<br>
				Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br>
				<br>
				As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>
				When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,<br>
				So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br>
				With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.<br>
				And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof
				The <!-- prancing --><span class="words" id="verb"></span>  and pawing of each little hoof.<br>
				As I drew in my hand, and was turning around,<br>
				Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.<br>
				<br>
				He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,<br>
				And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;<br>
				A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>
				And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.<br>
				<br>
				His eyes -- how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!<br>
				His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!<br>
				His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
				And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;<br>
				The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br>
				And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;<br>
				<br>
				He had a broad face and a little round belly,<br>
				That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.<br>
				He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br>
				And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>
				A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,<br>
				Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;<br>
				<br>
				He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
				And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br>
				And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>
				And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;<br>
				<br>
				He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
				And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.<br>
				But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br>
				HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!<br>
